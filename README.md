# COMP257/ITEC657 Group Project

Our project is an analysis of several socioeconomic factors and an attempt to use these factors in a NSW state context to explain the election results for the NSW 2019 state election.
Our goal is to be able to as best we can predict an electorates vote and discuss which factors best determine the results.

### All of our Data was obtained from: 

- Australian Bureau of Statistics, www.abs.gov.au, pulling the census data to train our prediction methods
- Australian Electoral Commission, www.aec.gov.au, containing the results for the 2019 Federal election
- NSW Electorale commission, vtr.elections.nsw.gov.au/la/state/elected, containing results for the 2019 NSW election

Project Title: Data analysis of 2019 Elections

## Summary 

The australian federal election was considered a large upset by media sources across the country. The aim of this project is to take possibly relevant socio-economic factors within state electorates and see whether we can accurately predict the two party outcome of a particular eletorate. 

Our chosen variables for this project are as follows:

Age - Average age of an electorate

Ancestry - % of electorate who selected North-west European as their ancestry

Children - Average number of children each respondant population has

Income - Average weekly income of electorate

Education - % of electorate population that has completed year 12 of High School

### Our files

There are two primary notebooks - *Initialization.ipynb* and *Final_Report.ipynb*.
- Initialization.ipynb will be a summarised version of Group Assignment Working notebook, containing the cleaning and creation of our csv files.
- Final_Report.ipynb will contain all of our analysis regarding the cleaned results from initialization.
Github commits regarding these 2 reports should be taken with a grain of salt, as they are summaries of our 3 working notebooks.

Group Assignment Working notebook.ipynb, Log.ipynb,and Seaborn Analysis.ipynb are all working notebooks seperated so that work could be performed at the same time via Github.

Our raw data is contained within Unclean Data/ and should contain 12 files.

Our clean data can be recreated from Final_report.ipynb and should contain 16 files when executed.
