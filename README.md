Our goal is to be able to as best we can predict an electorates vote and discuss which factors best determine the results

### All of our Data was obtained from: 

-Australian Bureau of Statistics, www.abs.gov.au, pulling the census data to train our prediction methods
-Australian Electoral Commission, www.aec.gov.au, containing the results for the 2019 Federal election

# Summary

Age - Average age of an electorate
Ancestry - % of electorate who selected North-west European as their ancestry
Children - Average number of children each respondant population has
Income - Average weekly income of electorate
Education - % of electorate population that has completed year 12 of High School

# Our files

Of the notebooks, all workbooks will be summarised within Final_report.ipynb, and all execution will be performable within

Group Assignment Working notebook.ipynb , Log.ipynb, and Seaborn Analysis.ipynb are all working notebooks seperated so that work could be performed at the same time via github

Our raw data is contained within Unclean Data/ and should contain 12 files
Our clean data can be recreated from Final_report.ipynb and should contain 16 files when executed
